Let X1, X2, ..., Xn be a sequence of independent and
identically distributed random variables with
E[Xi] = mu and Var[Xi] = sigma squared < infinity, 
and let

Sn = 1/n times the sum for i from 1 to n of Xi

denote their mean. Then as n approaches infinity, the
random variables square root n(Sn - mu) converge in
distribution to a normal N(0; sigma squared).
